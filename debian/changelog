    upstream and rename the remaining, permanent patch in accordance with the

  * Documentation changes:
    + Upstream has separated the Release Notes part of the User Manual into an
      own document.
    + Upstream has integrated the HTML documentation into the upstream package,
      thus it has become superfluous to create it at package build time.
    + Resulting packaging changes:

        ‣ docbook-xsl

    release 0.7.9~exp1:
    + 10_analyze_failure.dpatch: Drop filtering of the warning.
    + debian/control: Version the dependency on python-apt (>= 0.7.9~exp1).
  * 10_analyze_failure.dpatch: On failure try to identify a typical error
    scenario (cyrillic document with none of the needed options specified) and
    emit a corresponding hint.  Thanks to Ivan Shmakov for the suggestion.
    Closes: #525688

    + docbook-xml
    + docbook-xsl
    + ghostscript

    HTML creation needs two patches:
  * 20_html_doc_external_programlisting.dpatch:
    Fix inclusion of external programlistings into the user manual in a way
    that it works also for the HTML version.
  * 20_html_doc_missing_images.dpatch:
    Provide some missing images referenced in the DocBook source, thus they
    get included also in the HTML version.
    New dependencies (Build-Depends-Indep):
    + sharutils
  * Remove the cleanup code for non-configuration files in /etc/dblatex/ (BTS
    bug #395207) as outdated: meanwhile a fixed version has migrated to
