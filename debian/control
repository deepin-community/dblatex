Description: Produces DVI, PostScript, PDF documents from DocBook sources
 DocBook to LaTeX Publishing that transforms your SGML/XML DocBook documents to
 DVI, PostScript or PDF by translating them in pure LaTeX as a first process.
 MathML 2.0 markups are supported, too.  It originally started as a clone of
 DB2LaTeX, but has been enhanced extensively since then and is actively
 maintained by the upstream author.
